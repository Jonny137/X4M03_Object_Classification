# X4M03_Object_Classification

### Introduction

Simple algorithm for object classification by shape (two classes, round and rectangular) based on signals received from X4M03 impulse radar.

Besides custom neural network, two standard classification algorithms were used, Random Forest and XGBoost.

Everything was developed using Python 3.7, Windows 10 OS and Tensorflow 2.0 library.

### Usage

For simple interaction with X4M03 radar module on Windows 10 OS, run **read_raw_data.py** script.

For training the model using Random Forest and XGBoost run **std_classifiers.py** script.

For training the model using custom neural network run **nn_train.py** script.
